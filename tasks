Need to implement tests for the rest of the files in the validation
middleware folder. Would like to know the best way to organise 
the routes as well. 


Questions: 

Is it possible to retreive a value from beforeAll like this? 

import * as request from 'supertest'
import server from '../../src/app'
import { userModel } from '../../src/Models/User';

let jsonWebToken

const registeredEmail = "register@gmail.com"
const registeredPassword = "12345678"

const registrationRoute = '/user/register'
const loginRoute = '/auth/login'

beforeAll(async () => {
    await userModel.deleteMany({});
    await request(server).post(registrationRoute).send(
        {
            userName: "registeredUser",
            email: registeredEmail,
            password: registeredPassword
        }
    )
    const response = await request(server).post(loginRoute).send({
        email: registeredEmail,
        password: registeredPassword
    })
    jsonWebToken = response.body.jsonWebToken
})

Where is the best place to store interfaces for requests? Is it in the validation schema or in 
it's own file? 

Is there a benefit for defining an interface for response.locals between middlewares? 

Is it ok to duplicate middlewares if they are for a different middleware chain?
