1) What do you think of the solution to initialise solo streak tracker jobs? 
2) How would you intergration test the solo streak tracker jobs to ensure they are going to work in production? 
3) How would you clear the database after each intergration test? 
4) What do you think about the complete team member task being responsible for manipulating the team streak, should it return the updated team streak in the response? I think not because it's restful. 
5) How would you design an event tracker. I want to track everything like if someone edits a name of a strak. Archives it or completed something. Would you have one collection for these events or combine evevents from everything? What are the tradeoffs? 
6) What resources should I look at to get started with infastructure as code?
7) Is terraform the way to go? 
8) One of my big concerns at the moment is uptime of the agenda jobs what can I do to make sure it stays updated
9) What should I add to my beanstalk instance to keep up up time. Right now it's just one beanstalk instance. 
10) Need to ask Maxime what I should be doing for monitoring off the application. 
11) Ask Maxime what should be testing what should the SDK have intergration tests or should these be running against the local host? Or should the server just have the tests. 
12) Ask maxime what I need to consider for profile pictures, in regards to security and sizing them. Should this be done with a lambda on S3?
13) How should I handle the resizing of images, because it takes a long time on the server. I'm guessing send the response early and process afterwards? 
14) Ask Maxime how he would store each object in a bucket for user profiles.
