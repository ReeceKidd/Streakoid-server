1) What do you think of the solution to initialise solo streak tracker jobs? 
2) How would you intergration test the solo streak tracker jobs to ensure they are going to work in production? 
3) How would you clear the database after each intergration test? 
4) What do you think about the complete team member task being responsible for manipulating the team streak, should it return the updated team streak in the response? I think not because it's restful. 
5) How would you design an event tracker. I want to track everything like if someone edits a name of a strak. Archives it or completed something. Would you have one collection for these events or combine evevents from everything? What are the tradeoffs? 
6) What resources should I look at to get started with infastructure as code?
7) Is terraform the way to go? 
8) One of my big concerns at the moment is uptime of the agenda jobs what can I do to make sure it stays updated
9) What should I add to my beanstalk instance to keep up up time. Right now it's just one beanstalk instance.
